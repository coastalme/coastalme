# Community

CoastalME's community interacts on GitHub through [CoastalME Discussions](https://github.com/apayo/CoastalME/discussions/19#discussion-7445785), [Master-GitHub](https://github.com/apayo/CoastalME) and [Testing-GitHub](https://github.com/davefavismortlock/CoastalME_TESTING).
Please feel welcome to ask questions and participate in all of the venues.  The coastalme-dev channel is for general questions, development discussion, and feedback. The `GitHub` communication channel is for development activities, bug reports, and testing. 

We follow the GitHub general guideline on which discussion tool media we use https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/communicating-on-github#which-discussion-tool-should-i-use

## Code of Conduct

CoastalME uses a [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which governs how we behave in any CoastalME forum or event and whenever we will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who participates in the CoastalME community formally or informally, or claims any  affiliation with the project.

## CoastalME Discussions

Developers and users of CoastalME participate on the [CoastalME Discussions](https://github.com/apayo/CoastalME/discussions/19#discussion-7445785). It is OK to ask questions about how to use CoastalME, how to integrate CoastalME into your own software, and report issues that you might have.


## GitHub

Visit http://github.com/apayo/coastalME/issues to file issues you might be having with the software. GitHub is also where you can obtain a current development version of the software in the `git` revision control system. The CoastalME project is eager to take contributions in all forms, and we welcome those who are willing to roll up their sleeves and start filing tickets, pushing code, generating builds, and answering questions.


## Governance and Community Participation

### OSGeo Project Membership

Originally, CoastalME has been lead by Andres Payo and David Favis-Mortlock, being David the original author of much of CoastalME and Andres the principal investigator of this project, though with contributions and input from a variety of people. 

As of November 2024 CoastalME started the process of becoming a founding project of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)](https://www.osgeo.org/) and began a transition to a more community oriented governance model - in keeping with OSGeo expectations.

Membership as an OSGeo project will provide assurances that a variety of best practices are being employed by the CoastalME project, and that users and contributors can be assured of responsible project operation and continuity of the project. In particular:

- A consensus oriented Project Management Committee will be in charge of the project.
- Project source code and contributions will be vetted to ensure code is properly made available, protecting contributors and users of CoastalME.
- Part of the systems infrastructure used by the project is provided by the foundation, with responsible backup and redundancy to minimize disruptions.


### Project Steering Committee (PSC)

As of November 2024 (following the CoastalME 1.2 release) the project has been placed in the hands of a Project Steering Committee. This project steering committee operates under the rules of [rfc1_pmc.md](rfc/rfc1_pmc.md), and is overall responsible for decisions related to the CoastalME project. The current members are (@github username):

- Andres Payo 		   (@coastalme) 
- David Favis-Mortlock (@davefavismortlock)
- Mike Walkden		   (@xxxx)
- Manuel Cobos	       (@xxxx)
- Wilf Chun			   (@xxxx)

Note that discussion of proposals to the PSC take place on [CoastalME Discussions](https://github.com/apayo/CoastalME/discussions/19#discussion-7445785), and input from all subscribers is welcome.
