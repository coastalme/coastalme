; This is the sediment input event data file.
;
; The associated shapefile stores at least one point or line, which is tagged with a unique numeric ID.
;
; If "Sediment input type" in the main input file is P ("Point") mode, then a point shapefile is required. Each point in
; this shapefile is tagged with an ID. Each sediment input event (below) also has a location ID. Unconsolidated sediment
; is deposited at the point with the matching ID tag. In this mode, values for the "coast-normal length L" and
; "along-coast-width W" are ignored. Note that more than one sediment input event can occur with the same location ID, at
; different times.
;
; If "Sediment input type" in the main input file is set to C ("Coast") mode, then a point shapefile is required. Each
; point in this shapefile is tagged with an ID. Each sediment input event (below) also has a location ID. Unconsolidated
; sediment is deposited as a block at the point on the coast which is closest to the point with the matching ID tag. This
; is necessary because the coastline moves during the simulation. Therefore it is not possible to exactly specify, before
; the simulation begins, a location which is guaranteed to be on the coastline at a given time. In "Coast" mode, sediment
; input is assumed to be in the shape of an approximately rectangular block, which has uniform thickness (height),
; extends a length L into the sea (normal to the coastline), and has an along-coastline width W. Note that more than one
; sediment input event can occur with the same location ID, at different times.
;
; If "Sediment input type" in the main input file is set to L ("Line") mode then a line shapefile is required. Each line
; in this shapefile is tagged with an ID. Each sediment input event (below) also has an ID. Unconsolidated sediment is
; deposited at the intersection of the with the matching ID, and a coastline. In this mode, values for the "coast-normal
; length L" and "along-coast-width W" are ignored. Note that more than one sediment input event can occur with the same
; line ID, at different times.
;
; Each row below contains data for a single sediment input event, and must include the following comma-separated values:
;  * the location or line ID of the sediment input event (same as the ID in the shapefile. IDs start from 1 and run
;    consecutively
;  * the time of the sediment input event. This can be either relative (i.e. a number of hours or days after the
;    simulation start) or absolute (i.e. a time/date in the format hh-mm-ss dd/mm/yyyy)
;  * the volume (m3) of fine sediment in the sediment event
;  * the volume (m3) of sand sediment in the sediment event
;  * the volume (m3) of coarse sediment in the sediment event
;  * the coast-normal length L (m) of the sediment block (only needed if sediment input type is "Coast")
;  * the along-coast width W (m) of the sediment block (only needed if sediment input type is "Coast")
;
; Rows should be in time sequence. If more than one sediment input event occurs simultaneously (i.e. events occur at the
; same time at more than one location or line), then list each event on its own line.
