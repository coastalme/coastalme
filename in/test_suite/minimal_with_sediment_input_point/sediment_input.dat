; This is a POINT sediment input event data file
;
; If "Sediment input type" in the main input file is P ("Point"), then a point shapefile is required. Each point (there must be at least one) in this shapefile is tagged with a unique numeric "location ID".
;
; Each sediment input event (below) also has a "location ID". Sediment (unconsolidated or consolidated) is deposited at the point with the matching ID tag. In this point mode, values for the "coast-normal length L" and "along-coast-width W" are ignored.
;
; Note that more than one sediment input event can occur with the same location ID, at different times.
;
; Each row below contains data for a single sediment input event, and must include the following comma-separated values:
;  * the "location ID" of the sediment input event (same as the ID in the shapefile. IDs start from 1 and run consecutively
;  * the time of the sediment input event. This can be either relative (i.e. a number of hours or days after the simulation start) or absolute (i.e. a time/date in the format hh-mm-ss dd/mm/yyyy)
;  * the volume (m3) of fine unconsolidated sediment in the sediment event
;  * the volume (m3) of sand unconsolidated sediment in the sediment event
;  * the volume (m3) of coarse unconsolidated sediment in the sediment event
;
; Rows should be in time sequence. If more than one sediment input event occurs simultaneously (i.e. events occur at the same time at more than one location or line), then list each event on its own line.
